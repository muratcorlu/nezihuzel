  ROME, Sept. 14 -Pope at **Regensburg University** with what he conceded were "brusque" words about **Islam**: He quoted a **14th Century Byzantine emperor** as saying, "Show me just what **Muhammad** brought that was new, and there you will find things only **evil and inhuman**, such as his command to **spread** by the sword the **faith** he preached."

**Benedict** also used the word "**jihad,"** or holy war, saying that violence was contrary to **God's nature and to reason**. But, at the end of a speech that did not otherwise mention **Islam,** he also said that reason could be the basis for "that genuine **dialogue of cultures and religions** so urgently needed today."

Muslim leaders strongly **criticized** a speech he gave on his trip that used unflattering language about **Islam.**

Some of the **strongest** words came from **Turkey**, possibly putting in jeopardy **Benedict's** scheduled visit there in November.

"I do not think any good will come from the visit to the **Muslim world** of a person who has such ideas about **Islam's prophet**," Ali Bardakoglu, a cleric who is head of the **Turkish government's** directorate of **religious affairs**, said in a television interview there. "He should first of all replace **the grudge in his heart** with moral values and respect for the other."

The criticism from Mr. **Bardakoglu,** the Islamic leader in Turkey, was especially **strong,** and carries with it particular embarrassment if **Benedict** is forced to cancel or delay his visit to **Turkey.** Many Turks are already critical of **Benedict**, who as Cardinal **Joseph Ratzinger** had in 2004 opposed **Turkey'**s entry into the [European Union](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org "More articles about the European Union.").

The official, Mr. **Bardakoglu**, demanded an apology, saying that the remarks "**reflect the hatred in his heart** - it is a statement full of enmity and grudge." **(Courtesy Newyork Times)**

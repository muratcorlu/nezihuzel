![israil.jpg](/uploads/2006/11/israil.jpg)The **Iraqi** authorities have deeply refuted **British channel _BBC 2_** information, according to which, **Israeli** instructors would train **Kurdish soldiers** in Iraq. Yet, the concerned **authorities** were not able to explain the **testimonys** and the images **collected.**

_The **Newsnight**_ magazine of **September 19th**, 2006 had presented **exclusive images** of huge installations and these trainings. **"Interop**" and "**Colosseum**", two Israeli **mercenary** companies would have served as a **cover** to this activity of **Tsahal.** The officers would pass in **transit** through **Djibouti** to mask their origin.

The **Israelis** would have succeeded to the **American mercenary** companies already present in **Iraqi Kurdistan** since the creation of the **non-overflight a**rea, at the end of the "**Desert Storm"** operation, in 1991. The presence of **Israeli** instructors in **Iraq** had been **disclosed,** more than **one year** ago, by the **Israeli press** itself, but this operation details were not **known.**

The **néo-conservatives** are looking forward to create an **independent Kurdistan** via exploding **Iraq** and severing **Turkey** and **Syria**, at the same time. Such a **project** requires the creation of a **Kurdish army**.(Courtesy **Réseau Voltaire**)

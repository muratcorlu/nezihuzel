Across the **world,** a popular present for the **reading classes** this Christmas will be a novel by **Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk**. He has the politics of moneyed **liberal-leftism**, but all that matters to **Pamuk** is writing novels.Earlier this year, he said **Turkey** should examine what happened to the **one million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds killed in Turkey** in the 20th century. No nation easily **examines its past**. **Serbs and Croatians** remain in **denial** about the evil of the **Balkan wars** a decade ago. **Japan** cannot handle what it did in **China** seven decades ago; **China** cannot admit **Mao's murder** of millions.

For **Pamuk** to go into taboo areas of **Turkish history** was therefore a risk. But writers are there to take on the **creeping** tide of **censorship** that has been **fuelled** by religious **fundamentalists** and **ultra-nationalists.**

**Turkey's** new **ayatollahs** claim they are protecting the **secular nationalist state,** yet they ape the religious **censors** of Iran. The **Armenian massacres** happened in the decade before **Ataturk** launched his bid to **modernise** Turkey, and **Ataturk** remains historical enemy No 1 for **Muslim fundamentalists**, because he **secularised** Turkey, allowed **Muslim Turks** to drink in bars and encouraged **dancing** with women.

**Turkey's** modernisation now means the EU. **Ultra-nationalists** in **Turkey,** like Notting Hill Tories, dislike the **EU** because it involves sharing **sovereignty**. In the court room where **Pamuk's** case was heard, the hate word **was 'European'.** Nationalists screamed abuse at **MEPs** and I was punched in the face by a **nationalist lawyer.**

It won't. As in past **centuries**, state authorities or religious **fundamentalists** have put a writer on trial to stop him or her asking **awkwar**d questions, but end up in the dock themselves. After the hearing, a **frightened Pamuk** asked me if he should go into **exile**. I hope not. **Turkey** will not join **Europe** unless **Voltaire** wins, and the **ayatollahs** \- secular and religious - lose.
